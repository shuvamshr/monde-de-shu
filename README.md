This is a project I've been working on, as a practice for frontend engineering, while also strategizing a business plan. Let's see how it goes.

If you stumbled on this somehow, this wasn't meant to be seen yet. I just needed to make this repo public to make GitHub pages work.

If you are still reading this, hit me up on LinkedIn, and I'd love to chat about if there's a potential for partnership or collaboration on this project.
